# LottoAmericaDataFun

## Overview

This project serves as a hands-on exercise to practice data science coding techniques while exploring Lotto America lottery results. While acknowledging that lottery outcomes are entirely random, this project delves into scraping, data transformation, and statistical exploration to enhance technical skills and demonstrate proficiency in working with real-world data.

### Key Features
- **Web Scraping**: Dynamically retrieves past Lotto America results by simulating user interactions with the Powerball website.
- **Data Transformation**: Converts raw lottery data into structured formats for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conducts statistical explorations and visualizations to uncover patterns in historical results (for educational purposes).
- **Focus on Technical Skills**: A demonstration of Python, data manipulation with Pandas, and visualization libraries.

## Lotto America Results Scraper

### Description

This Python script retrieves past Lotto America draw results from the official Powerball website. It simulates interactions with the "Load More" button via HTTP requests to gather all available data. The script then processes the results, parsing draw dates, winning numbers, star balls, and multipliers into a structured format.
